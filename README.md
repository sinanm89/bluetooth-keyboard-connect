bluetooth-keyboard-connect
==========================

Connect your keyboard (in my case a logitech K810) to your computer everytime your computer starts. This is a method to be used if when you change OS's often and find that the keyboard has to be re-paired everytime and the pairing process is as cumbersome as the K810.
